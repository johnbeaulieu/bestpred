===============================================================================
04/28/2015  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc7  JBC     Fixed a bug in Format 4 processing
						reported by Miels Hostens that was
						caused by a mixup between f248 and
						n248 strings when writing data to
						the format4 variable passed into
						bestpred_fmt4.f90. The values
						written to the format4 variable
						were being taken from f248 in all
						cases, never from n248, so the data
						from the input file were never
						being passed downstream.
04/24/2015  Documentation       2.0rc7  JBC     Updated the documentation on
						minimal Format 4 records (source
						10 processing).
04/24/2015  Makefiles           2.0rc7  JBC     Tweaked compiler options.
04/24/2015  all *.f90 files     2.0rc7  JBC     There are about 1,000,000
						compiler warnings that need to
						be fixed. Or I can change the
						makefile to turn off a bunch of
						them. ;-)
04/24/2015  bestpred_fmt4.dat   2.0rc7  JBC     If a minimal Format 4 does NOT
						include a state code in bytes
						107-108 of the record then it's
						set to 0. This causes the aiplage
						routine to return some...odd...
						values for the age adjustment
						factors. Going forward, if the
						state is 0 then it will be set
						to 35 (Wisconsin) and a message
						printed to STDOUT. This fixes a
						bug reported by Miel Hostens and
						his colleagues.
04/21/2015  bestpred.f90        2.0rc7  JBC     In the vary() function code 4
						had a value of 0., which results
						in very low DCR for robotic
						herds. Changed to 1. to match
						supervised herds. This resolves
						a bug reported by AgSource.
04/21/2015  bestpred.f90        2.0rc7  JBC     Made some minor formatting changes
						to the lactation summaries.
11/19/2014  bestpred_main,f90   2.0rc7  JBC	Added CURVEsingle to the parm
            bestpred_parm.f90			file. When 0, all cow curve
            bestpred_fmt4.f90			and lactation summary results
            bestpred.f90			are written to the same file.
						When 1, a separate file is
						written for each cow.
11/18/2014  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc7  JBC	Corrected a typo relating to
						persistency floors & ceilings.
11/18/2014  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc7  JBC	Added new input format, source
						24, that reads a file named
						pcdart_files.txt. Each line
						in that file is the name of a
						file that contains source 14
						records. This lets a user
						process animals from different
						herds in one run of bestpred
						to avoid repeatedly paying
						startup costs.
10/02/2014  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc7  JBC     Corrected the format string
						so that the columns in Format
						14 (.bpo) files are no longer
						run together. Thanks to Albert
						de Vries at UF for reporting
						the problem.
10/02/2014  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc7  JBC	Added an INTERFACE block for
						the interpolate() subroutine
						so that the oprional arguments
						(region and season) are now
						correctly handled. Thanks to
						John Beaulieu at ATA for
						reporting the problem.
08/13/2009  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc6  JBC     Removed maxshow from the para-
                                                meter statement so that the
                                                correct number of lactation
                                                summaries is now shown when
                                                using the standalone version.
08/13/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc6  JBC     Summary information, such as
                                                the table of lactation average
                                                yields, is now printed only
                                                the first time bestpred() is
                                                called when processing many
                                                records from format4.dat.
08/13/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc6  JBC     Cow identification is now
                                                printed with the table of
                                                ME and actual yields.
08/11/2009  ageadjs.c           2.0rc6  JBC     Updated to the latest version,
                                                which uses additive rather
                                                than multiplicative factors
                                                for SCS.
08/11/2009  bestpred_fmt4.f90   2.0rc6  JBC     Changed edits on TD segments
                                                w/status 2 to let SCS through
                                                rather than blanking it.
08/11/2009  bestpred_fmt4.f90   2.0rc6  JBC     SCS herd averages now divided
                                                by 100 just before the call to
                                                bestpred().
08/11/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc6  JBC     Herd average SCS are now on the
                                                phenotypic scale, e.g., 3.20,
                                                rather than multiplied by 100.
                                                This is necessary for compat-
                                                ibility with the AIPL edits
                                                system.
03/16/2009  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc5  JBC     Fixed a format statement that
                                                caused G95 to throw warnings
                                                on the Windows build.
03/16/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc5  JBC     Corrected use of non-portable
                                                inequality operators that were
                                                breaking Windows builds..
03/13/2009  Documentation       2.0rc4  JBC     Updated documentation to reflect
                                                changes to parameters and file
                                                formats. Added new material to the
                                                Troubleshooting chapter.
03/13/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc4  JBC     Added the \var{CURVEsmall} parameter,
                                                which controls what variables are
                                                written to the CURVEfile.
03/13/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc4  JBC     GRAFplot now toggles traits
                                                writtenen to CURVEfile on and off.
03/13/2009  bestpred,f90        2.0rc4  JBC     Output curve files now contain
                                                only one TD yield column.
03/13/2009  bestpred_parm.f90   2.0rc4  JBC     Moved all of the version data
            bestpred_main.f90                   out of the parameter file and
            bestpred_fmt4.f90                   into the bestpred subroutine.
            bestpred.f90
03/13/2009  bestpred.f90        2.0rc4  JBC     Fixed a bug in which missing
                                                values in the DAILYbp were
                                                mistakenly set to 0.0, which
                                                resulted in very strange plots.
10/17/2008  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc3  JBC     Merged-in Brad Heins's code
                                                for reading previous days open
                                                from columns 246 through 248 of
                                                Format 4 (source 10 and 15)
                                                records.
10/16/2008  bestpred_main.f90   2.0rc3  JBC     Added code to support source
                                                15, which is the same as 10
                                                but 305-d herd averages are
                                                also read from the file
                                                format4.means. The means are
                                                stored in the first row of
                                                the herd305 array
                                                (herd305(1,:).
08/19/2008  All makefiles	2.0rc2	JBC	Rearranged the makefiles such
						that all dependencies are
						built and linked in the
						correct order. I don't know
						the Absoft linker ever worked
						with the default file!
08/19/2008  bestpred.f90	2.0rc2	JBC	Added a few lines of code to
						better handle records with no
						test days. Thanks to Jim Boyer
						for noting the bugs and
						providing working code.
08/19/2008  bestpred_fmt4.f90	2.0rc2	JBC	Removed logging and parameter
						file dependencies.
08/19/2008  bestpred.f90	2.0rc2	JBC	Removed logging dependency.
08/19/2008  makefile.g95	2.0rc2	JBC	Fixed makefile for use with
						the G95 Fortran compiler.
08/18/2008  bestpred.f90	2.0rc2  JBC     Removed mature parameter from
                                                the ymean() subroutine header.
08/18/2008  makefile.gnu        2.0rc2  JBC     Replaced references to maindcr
						with references to bestpred;
						removed the -static directive
						from calls to gfortran because
						they wreck [sic] havoc with
						OSX.
08/11/2008  Best Prediction Manual.pdf	JBC	Added material on using
						simulated data to test a new
						installation.
08/08/2008  Best Prediction Manual.pdf	JBC	Added material to some tables;
						corrected typos; updated default
						parameter values.
08/08/2008  bestpred_main.f90	2.0rc1	JBC	Added debugging code to display
						the data returned by the
						bestpred() subroutine; it is
						activated by setting maxprnt to	
						-1.
08/08/2008  bestpred_main.f90	2.0rc1	JBC	Added maxshow to the subroutine
						header. This fixes graph display
						problems in which maxshow and
						maxprnt were not working properly.
08/08/2008  bestpred_fmt4.f90	2.0rc1	JBC	Added maxshow to the call to
						bestpred().
08/08/2008  bestpred_main.f90	2.0rc1	JBC	Added maxshow to the call to
						bestpred_fmt4().
08/07/2008  bestpred_main.f90	2.0rc1	JBC	Made modifications to the code
						that prints incoming data for
						debugging. The data were being
						displayed in kilograms regardless
						of the input units. The printout
						now uses same units as the
						incoming data.
08/06/2008  Best Prediction Manual.pdf  JBC     Updated to reflect new file
                                                formats, removal of the mature
                                                parm, uses of GRAFplot, and
                                                the logging module.
08/07/2008  bestpred_parm.f90   2.0b9   JBC     Added code to check GRAFplot
                                                for permissible values; if
                                                invalid values are found the
                                                default of 2 (actual values)
                                                is used.
08/07/2008  bestpred.f90        2.0b9   JBC     GRAFplot is now checked for
                                                permissible values and used as
                                                an index in plot drawing to
                                                toggle between ME and actual
                                                plots.
08/06/2008  bestpred.f90        2.0b9   JBC     Fixed an array with incorrect
                                                dimensions that was corrupting
                                                herd averages.
08/06/2008  bestpred_fmt4.f90   2.0b9   JBC	Changed how 305d herd averages
                                                are calculated.
08/06/2008  bestpred_main.f90	2.0b9	JBC	Fixed another bug w/lactation
						length handling.
08/05/2008  bestpred.f90        2.0b9   JBC     Removed 'mature' parameter from
                                                the subroutine. Mature and ME
                                                yields are now returned from a
                                                single call to the subroutine.
08/05/2008  bestpred_fmt4.f90   2.0b9   JBC     Removed 'mature' parameter.
08/05/2008  bestpred_parm.f90   2.0b9   JBC     Removed 'mature' parameter.
08/05/2008  bestpred_main.f90   2.0b9   JBC     Removed 'mature' parameter.
08/05/2008  bestpred_main.f90   2.0b9   JBC     Fixed a bug in which the lengths
                                                of sample lactations read from
                                                DCRexample.txt were not being
                                                correctly calculated.
04/03/2008  Best Prediction Manual.pdf	JBC	Updated manual.
04/03/2008  bestpred_log.f90	2.0b8	JBC	Fixed a glitch in the header
						of newly-created log files.
03/19/2006  bestpred*.f90       2.0b8   JBC     Modified parameter lists to support
                                                logging tools.
03/13/2006  bestpred_main.f90   2.0b8   JBC     Removed unused variable declarations
                                                to get a clean compile.
03/12/2006  makefile            2.0b8   JBC     Added entries for compiling the
                                                logging module.
03/12/2006  bestpred_log.f90    2.0b8   JBC     Added logging module.
03/12/2006  bestpred_main.f90   2.0b8	JBC	Made changes to input record
						processing so that the last
						record read from source 10
						is no longer skipped. Also
						verified that I did not break
						processing of records w/0 TD.
12/19/2007  bestpred.f90        2.0b8   JBC     Updated all lactation curves
                                                (mean and SD for MFPS) to use
                                                parameters based on 1 versus
                                                2-and-later parities using up
                                                to 500-d data for MFP and
						999-d data for SCS instead of
						1 versus 3+ parities.

                                                in the vary() function with
                                                new values from a corrected
                                                program.
12/10/2007  bestpred.f90        2.0b7   JBC     Updated mean and SD lactation
                                                curves for all breeds and traits.
12/05/2007  bestpred_fmt4.f90   2.0b7   JBC     Modified the format4 string to
                                                take up to 50 TD rather than
                                                20 as in the Format 4
                                                specification.
12/05/2007  bestpred_main.f90   2.0b7   JBC     Modified the format4 string to
                                                take up to 50 TD rather than
                                                20 as in the Format 4
                                                specification. Commented out
                                                JBC code for writing lactation
                                                curves b/c (1) the code didn't
                                                work correctly, and (2) curves
                                                are now written to files by a
                                                function in bestpred.f90.
12/04/2007  bestpred.f90        2.0b7   JBC     Updated lactation curve parms for
                                                later parity M, F, and P in the
                                                interpolate subroutine from the 305
                                                d Dematawewa et al. (2007) parms to
                                                the 999 d parms.
12/04/2007  standard_curves.py  2.0b7   JBC     Updated lactation curve parms for
                                                later parity HO M, F, and P from the
                                                305 d Dematawewa et al. (2007) parms
                                                to the 999 d parms.
